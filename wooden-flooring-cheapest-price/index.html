            </p><p>It is about a year or so old and my remote control stopped working. I have an 85 samsung tv. My remote won't connect to the tv. When i try a control the volume with the samsung remote, a pop up appears confirming the receiver is set to optical, but volume control does not work. I have a 2022 samsung smart tv with a solar remote, it was working fine until it was unresponsive. It's been about a week of constantly having to do that, but now it won't connect at all. Is there another way to turn cc off? Only thing i can think to do is reset tv to factory.</p>

        <p>The remote control is fully charged. It is a solar powered remote control and when using my cell phone camera i can not see any lights being transmitted out of it but i do see the red light at. Unfortunately, when i called samsung tech support, it took more than 90 minutes for them to tell me that the remote will not control optical sound.</p>

        <p>I&#039;ve tried all the diagnostic checking and reseting, replaced batteries, cleaned remote contacts, reset tv. Anytime a button is pressed on the remote, a grey box showing not available pops up. “not available “ is displayed on the screen when any other button is pressed.</p>
