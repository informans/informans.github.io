I know i can see my remaining limit and do the math but it's still a little bit annoying. The types of questions you should expect are mostly behavioral (related to how you work, collaborate.) and you get either 1:30 or 3:00 minutes per question. Is this common with wells fargo? A few weeks after an elderly relative had her wells fargo card compromised (we got charges reversed), she got a call from wells fargo fraud department, checking to be sure she had received her new card. Wells fargo super check provided with the new credit card that has a 0% apr for 18 months with a 3% transfer fee They were able to confirm that the phone number on the letter was a real wf number. Hi, i have interviewed with wells fargo before and even received an offer from them for an internship.</p>

        <p>When i click on my checking account to get a more detailed view, it shows my paycheck going into my checking account. I just got their autograph card last week. The consumer financial protection bureau said wells fargo&#039;s &#039;illegal activity&#039; included repeatedly misapplying loan payments, wrongfully foreclosing on homes, illegally repossessing vehicles, incorrectly assessing fees and interest and charging surprise overdraft fees.</p>

        <p>A few weeks after an elderly relative had her wells fargo card compromised (we got charges reversed), she got a call from wells fargo fraud department, checking to be sure she had received her new card. That means for this month, it&#039;s suppose to be on monday, however for some reason i checked my balance today (online wells fargo) and on the summary page it shows that this money is in my account. I just got their autograph card last week.</p>
