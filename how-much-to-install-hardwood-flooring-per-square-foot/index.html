A negative 'q' indicates an exothermic reaction (heat released), while a positive 'q' denotes an endothermic reaction (heat absorbed). (this reaction also occurs in automobile engines and is partially responsible for smog production.) This article delves into the intricacies of bomb calorimetry, focusing on the analysis of temperature changes observed during a reaction and their implications for calculating. Because combustion reactions are exothermic, the temperature of the bath and the calorimeter increases during combustion. This means that the reaction produces heat for the solution to absorb and q for the reaction is negative. Yes, the change in temperature of water and calorimeter are the same at final equilibrium.</p>
