            </p><p>The fur trade each year, more than 1 billion rabbits and 50 million other animals — including foxes, seals, mink, and raccoon dogs — are raised on fur farms or trapped in the wild and killed for their pelts. Because much of the fur is imported from china and other countries that have poor regulation, it is often mislabeled as faux. The most reliable worldwide count from 2015 estimated that at least 192.1 million animals are being used for scientific research worldwide. The green party has accused officials of sugarcoating statistics. Procedures on animals are falling in number pandemic aside, the annual number of procedures has been falling steadily since 2015, a year in which 4.1 million procedures on animals were carried out. Each year more than 10 million such animals are destroyed at pounds or shelters, whereas fewer than 200,000 dogs and cats are released from pounds and shelters to scientific establishments for use in research—less than 2 percent of the number that are destroyed. Around 100 million rodents and other rodents are killed in u.s. Some will be used in more than one experiment.</p>
