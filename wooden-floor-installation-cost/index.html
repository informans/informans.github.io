            </p><p>Neither is technically a castle (burg); Hohenzollern castle is much bigger than lichtenstein palace. Hohenzollern castle is a stunning castle located on the frankish swabian hills in southwestern germany. The castle was modelled on similar constructions in england and france built in the gothic revival style. I would visit hohenzollern castle because of its spectacular situation and because of its connection to prussian and german history. Neuschwanstein was built by ludwig as his palace, having the outward appearance of a real castle, but just for his living quarters. In 1945 hohenzollern castle briefly became the home of the former crown prince wilhelm of germany, son of the last german monarch, kaiser wilhelm ii. Had not the time to visit schloss sigmaringen and saw it only from the outside, but must be worth a visit too.</p>

        <p>Hohenschwangau was built in around 1800 over the ruins of a real castle by ludwig&#039;s father, king of bavaria, as a fortified home for his family. Hohenzollern has english guided tours, lichtenstein german only but will explain in english briefly and they will give you an explanation on paper too. Traveling only by train, it seems hohenzollern castle is out of the way from anything on the recommended itinerary.</p>
