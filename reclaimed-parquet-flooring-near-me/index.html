            </p><p>Whenever i open a new chrome window or tab, in both a regular window and incognito window, instead of binging me to the google search page, it brings me directly to the yahoo search page. I'm having this problem for 2 months now i think, even though i haven't downloaded any suspicious lately i can't find out what the cause is. Ive gone through all my settings. In case they can assist you and you decide to get this subscription, you can always manage it online. Reddit is a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies and passions. Yahoo is an absolute shitshow apparently my account is blocked because of too many attempts (repeatedly over the past month), which unless a bot/hacker somewhere is trying to access my account, is untrue. This problem started happening about a month ago. Hi all, when i open a new tab (or use an existing one) to search for something, i get redirected to yahoo search.</p>
